    <h3> Why? </h3>

    <p>Climate change is one of the world's largest problems that needs to be resolved, estimated to kill 250,000 people
        a year. We need to save lives. We can do by conserving and reducing our carbon emmissions and footprints. Get a
        carpool, hop on a train or bus instead of driving, or even ride your bike! These simple actions can help save the
        average of 250,000 people killed by global warming each year. Let's change the world TOGETHER!</p>
