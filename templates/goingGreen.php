    <h1>Going Green</h1>

    <h3> Why? </h3>

    <p>Climate change is one of the world's largest problems that needs to be resolved, estimated to kill 250,000 people
        a year. We need to save lives. We can do by conserving and reducing our carbon emmissions and footprints. Get a
        carpool, hop on a train or bus instead of driving, or even ride your bike! These simple actions can help save the
        average of 250,000 people killed by global warming each year. </p>

    <p>Using the money you save from gas by using public means of transportation, it can be donated 
       to a non-profit organization known as</p>
       
       <b>OneTreePlanted,</b>

    
       <p>It uses its money donated to plant 
       trees, therefore helping the environment. They have doubled the number of trees planted
       per year consistently for many years! You can help this organization today by using our 
       website.</p>
